## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

First you have to install all packages via `npm install` and then: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

Currently, the npm run build script has already been run by me,
so in the build folder it is ready to be deployed, for example to the server.
